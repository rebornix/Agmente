## Logo

The ACP logo can be used with the "ACP" logomark with or without a gradient.
We provide a vertical and horizontal variant for display flexibility.

## Logomark

The logomark has a variation that includes a slight gradient on the bottom right part of it.
We don't enforce the use of one version over the other, meaning you can choose to use either of them as you wish, as long as you respect using it in pure white or pure black.
